# HumanActivityRecognition
This project implements Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using OpenCV and Deep Learning. It detects and classifies human activities in video data using motion detection and CNNs. Built with Python, OpenCV, and TensorFlow, itâ€™s optimized for real-time analysis without external hardware.
